# Youtube-Spam-Comments-Classifier
The "YouTube Spam Comment Classifier" is a machine learning project hosted on GitHub. The purpose of this project is to develop a classifier that can distinguish between spam and non-spam comments on YouTube videos. The repository contains the necessary code and resources to build and evaluate the classifier.
Here's a brief description of the key components and features of the project:
Dataset: The project utilizes a labeled dataset of YouTube comments, where each comment is classified as either spam or non-spam. The dataset is used for training and evaluating the classifier.

Preprocessing: The dataset goes through a preprocessing step to clean and prepare the comments for model training. This typically involves removing special characters, converting text to lowercase, handling stopwords, and performing tokenization.

Feature Extraction: The project employs various techniques to extract meaningful features from the comment text. Common techniques include using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings (such as Word2Vec or GloVe) to represent the comments as numerical vectors.

Classifier Model: Different machine learning algorithms or models are explored to build the spam comment classifier. This may include decision trees, logistic regression, SVM, or more advanced models like XGBoost or deep learning models.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the classifier is assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model is trained and tested on the labeled dataset, and the evaluation metrics provide insights into how well the classifier is able to differentiate between spam and non-spam comments.

Documentation: The repository includes documentation that describes the project, explains the code structure and functionality, and provides instructions on how to run and reproduce the results. It may also include information on the dataset, preprocessing techniques, model selection, and performance analysis.
